Project 2

Requirements Implemented:
- Req 1: 3D Character consisting of primitive shapes. Four levels of Hierarchy are presented on the headlights of the Trueno.
- Req 2: Added 3 sliders: Pop Lights (Allows you to pop the headlights of the Trueno and also put them back down if you'd like), Axel Width (Allows you to increase the width
of the Trueno's axels and subsequently move the tires further out or further in), and Turn Tires (Allows you to turn the front two tires of the Trueno).
- Req 3: The Axel Width, Pop Lights, and Turn Tires sliders are all tied to more than one component.
- Req 4: Animation is done directly within the draw method. Added a "turn table" animation where the Trueno slowly spins in circles, and added a pop lights animation
which makes the lights pop up and down. I couldn't figure out how to access the m_animating boolean, so instead I've commented out the parts that cause animation
to happen and they can be uncommented to see the animations. For the "turn table" animation, uncomment line 71. For the pop lights animation, uncomment 
lines 234 and 276.

Extra Credits:
- None

Other Notes: 
Added Black, White, Orange, and Yellow to the colors list and changed the camera's default position.
Was a fun project :)
